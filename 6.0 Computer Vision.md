## 6.1 Image Processing Basics

* **Introduction to Image Processing**:
    * Image processing is fundamental to many computer vision applications.
    * It involves manipulating digital images to improve quality, extract information, or prepare for further analysis.
    * This lecture covers core concepts: image representation, filtering, and transformations.

* **Image Representation, Filtering, and Transformations**:
    * **Image Representation**:
        * Digital images are composed of **pixels**, small areas represented by intensity values.
        * **Grayscale Images**: Each pixel has a single intensity (0=black to 255=white); used when color isn't essential (e.g., text recognition).
        * **RGB Images**: Colors are represented by three channels (Red, Green, Blue) combining intensities; common for digital photographs.
        * **Alternative Color Spaces**: HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value), YUV (luminance and chrominance), CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) offer specific advantages for different tasks (e.g., color-based detection, print preparation).
    * **Filtering Techniques**:
        * Modify spatial properties to achieve specific goals.
        * **Smoothing Filters**: Reduce noise and blur sharp transitions by averaging pixel values (e.g., **Gaussian blur**, **median filters**).
        * **Sharpening Filters**: Enhance edges and fine details by accentuating intensity differences (e.g., **Laplacian filter** for edges, **Sobel filters** for directional edges).
        * **Frequency Domain Filtering**: Transforms images using techniques like the **Fourier Transform** to manipulate specific frequency components (high-pass for edge enhancement, low-pass for noise reduction).
    * **Image Transformations**:
        * Modify spatial orientation, size, or shape.
        * **Geometric Transformations**: Alter pixel arrangement (e.g., **rotation**, **scaling** (resizing), **translation** (shifting), **affine transformations** (preserve parallel lines)).
        * **Perspective Transformation**: Corrects distortions from angled views, making objects appear straight (useful for document scanning).
        * **Histogram Equalization**: A contrast enhancement technique that redistributes pixel intensities to cover the full dynamic range, improving visibility in low-contrast images.

* **Practical Applications and Importance**:
    * These concepts are building blocks for sophisticated computer vision.
    * They enable:
        * Preparing images by removing noise and enhancing features.
        * Correcting distortions and normalizing conditions for consistent processing.

* **Types of Image Segmentation**:
    * **Semantic Segmentation**:
        * A pixel-level classification where every pixel is assigned a class based on its semantic meaning (e.g., "road," "vehicle," "building").

## 6.4 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

* **Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:
    * Introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014, GANs are revolutionary deep learning architectures.
    * They employ an **adversarial training process** where two neural networks, a **generator** and a **discriminator**, compete.
    * This competition enables GANs to generate synthetic data that closely resembles real data, opening possibilities from art generation to scientific research.
    * The core idea: the generator tries to create realistic synthetic data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated samples. This dynamic improves both networks.

* **Architecture, Training Process, and Applications**:
    * **Core Components of GANs**:
        * **Generator Network**:
            * The "creative" component.
            * Takes random **noise vectors** (from latent space, e.g., Gaussian distribution) as input.
            * Transforms noise into synthetic data (e.g., images) that should be indistinguishable from real data.
            * Learns to map noise to the target data distribution.
            * Objective: deceive the discriminator.
            * Architecture typically uses **transposed convolutions** (deconvolutional layers) to upsample the noise into full-resolution samples.
        * **Discriminator Network**:
            * The "critic" or "evaluator."
            * A binary classifier trained to distinguish between real data and synthetic data from the generator.
            * Learns to assign high probability to real data and low probability to generated data.
            * Typically a **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN) that downsamples input to a single probability value.
    * **Adversarial Training Process**:
        * A carefully orchestrated competition between generator and discriminator.
        * **Generator Training Phase**:
            * Generator improves its realism based on feedback from the discriminator.
            * If the discriminator correctly identifies fake samples, the generator receives a learning signal to improve.
            * Generator's loss function aims to *maximize* the probability that the discriminator classifies its output as real.
        * **Discriminator Training Phase**:
            * Discriminator is trained using *both* authentic real data and synthetic data from the current generator.
            * Discriminator's objective: *minimize* classification errors by correctly identifying real samples as real and fake samples as fake.
        * **Adversarial Feedback Loop**: Alternates between updating generator (more convincing fakes) and discriminator (better at detecting fakes).
        * **Equilibrium**: Ideally, the generator produces samples indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator's accuracy approaches 50% (random guessing).
    * **Applications and Use Cases**:
        * **Realistic Image Generation**: Generating photorealistic faces, landscapes, animals, art. Used for social media profiles, entertainment, synthetic datasets for research.
        * **Image-to-Image Translation**: Transforming images from one domain to another (e.g., sketches to photos, day to night, colorizing old photos, artistic style transfer).

        * **Super-Resolution and Image Enhancement**: Enhancing low-resolution images to high-resolution versions with more detail (e.g., medical image enhancement, satellite image improvement).

* **Advanced GAN Variants**:
    * **Conditional GANs (cGANs)**: Condition both generator and discriminator on additional information (class labels, attributes), enabling controlled generation. Useful for generating images of specific categories or attributes.
    * **Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)**: Uses deep convolutional neural networks in both generator and discriminator, improving training stability, image quality, and convergence. Employs strided convolutions, batch normalization, Leaky ReLU (discriminator), ReLU (generator).
    * **Wasserstein GANs (WGANs)**: Address training instability by using **Wasserstein distance** (Earth Mover's Distance) as objective function. Provides more meaningful loss metrics, stable training, reduced sensitivity to hyperparameters, mitigates mode collapse and vanishing gradients.
    * **Progressive GANs**: Novel training strategy starting with low-resolution image generation and progressively increasing resolution. Enables high-quality, high-resolution image generation with stable training.
    * **StyleGAN Architecture**: Introduces a style-based generator for fine-grained control over generated image characteristics. Separates aspects of generation for independent control over visual attributes.

* **Challenges and Considerations**:
    * **Mode Collapse**: Generator produces limited variety of samples, failing to capture full data diversity. Addressed by techniques like mini-batch discrimination, feature matching.
    * **Training Instability**: Adversarial process can oscillate instead of converging. Addressed by architectural improvements, regularization, alternative objective functions.
    * **Evaluation Challenges**: Difficult to assess quality and diversity. Metrics include **Inception Score (IS)**, **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**, **Perceptual Path Length (PPL)**.
    * **Computational Requirements**: Training, especially high-resolution variants, demands significant resources and hyperparameter tuning.

        * Splits datasets into train/val/test.
        * Loads and preprocesses images (`cv2.imread`, `cvtColor`, `resize`).
        * Applies comprehensive data augmentation (`albumentations` for flips, rotations, brightness/contrast, noise, elastic transforms).
        * Normalizes pixel values (e.g., to [-1, 1] for `tanh` output).
        * Creates TensorFlow `tf.data.Dataset` for efficient training.
    * **Advanced DCGAN Implementation (`AdvancedDCGAN`)**:
        * **Generator (`_build_generator`)**: Takes `latent_dim` noise, uses dense layer, `Reshape`, and **progressive upsampling** with **residual connections** for higher quality. Final `Conv2D` with `tanh` activation.
        * **Discriminator (`_build_discriminator`)**: Takes image, uses initial `Conv2D` (no BN), **progressive downsampling**. Final `GlobalAveragePooling2D` and `Dense(1)` output.
        * **Combined Model (`_build_combined_model`)**: Connects generator output to discriminator input. Discriminator weights are frozen during generator training.
        * **Compilation**: Uses `optimizers.Adam` (with different learning rates for generator/discriminator, TTUR - Two-Times Update Rule). Loss is `BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True, label_smoothing=0.1)`.
        * **Training (`train`)**: Iterates through epochs and batches.
            * **Discriminator Training**: Generates fake images, creates real/fake labels (with label smoothing for stability), calculates binary cross-entropy loss for both, and applies gradients.
            * **Generator Training**: Generates fake images, calculates generator loss (trying to fool discriminator), and applies gradients.
            * **Monitoring**: Tracks `discriminator_losses` and `generator_losses`.
            * **Saving/Sampling**: Saves generated images and model checkpoints at intervals.
    * **Comprehensive CycleGAN Implementation for Style Transfer (`CycleGAN`)**:
        * Handles **unpaired image-to-image translation**.
        * **Generators (`generator_AtoB`, `generator_BtoA`)**: Two generators for A-to-B and B-to-A translation. Use **residual blocks** and **instance normalization**.
        * **Discriminators (`discriminator_A`, `discriminator_B`)**: Two **PatchGAN discriminators** to classify patches as real/fake.
        * **Losses**:
            * **Generator Adversarial Loss**: `tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(fake_output - 1))`.
            * **Discriminator Loss**: `(real_loss + fake_loss) * 0.5`.
            * **Cycle Consistency Loss**: $\lambda_{cycle} \times ||real\_image - cycled\_image||_1$. Ensures image can be translated back to original domain.
            * **Identity Loss**: $\lambda_{identity} \times ||real\_image - same\_image||_1$. Encourages generator to preserve color composition when mapping input to itself.
        * **Training Step (`train_step`)**: Single forward/backward pass. Calculates all losses (generator, cycle, identity, discriminator) and applies gradients.
        * **Training (`train`)**: Iterates, logs losses, and generates sample translations.
    * **Advanced Evaluation and Quality Assessment (`GANEvaluator`)**:
        * **Inception Score (IS)**: Measures quality and diversity using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model.
        * **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**: Measures the distance between real and generated image feature distributions; lower FID means higher quality/diversity.
        * **`_get_inception_features` / `_get_inception_predictions`**: Helper functions to extract features/predictions from InceptionV3.

* **Summary Conclusion**:
    * GANs are powerful generative models that leverage an adversarial training process between a generator and a discriminator to create realistic synthetic data.
    * Their applications span realistic image generation, image-to-image translation, data augmentation, and super-resolution.
    * Advanced variants like cGANs, DCGANs, WGANs, Progressive GANs, and StyleGAN have significantly improved stability and control.
    * The hands-on implementation of DCGAN for image generation and CycleGAN for style transfer showcases the complexity and effectiveness of these models, while evaluation metrics like FID and IS are critical for assessing their performance.
